This is a straightforward story framework that combines bits and pieces from all of my games. The idea's very simple; you choose a node on a story map and play it out, using the prompts given, then choose a new node and repeat. When you can't get to an unplayed node, you play the climax instead.

It's not a game in and of itself, but rather a system for pushing a character through events. A GM Emulator, so speak. It has a full tarot in d66 form to handle oracle and world questions, and plenty of tables to provide inspiration and color.

The name's just random. I gave up there.
