The tenth game of my "one microRPG game a month" (OMGAM) challenge. This was kind of a last ditch effort as I find myself writing this with a miserable head cold, half an hour past the deadline.

A dreamlike riff on Otherkind and Roll For Shoes, with a loose place-based structure and a concrete goal.

* discover your character as you go
* focus on surviving, negotiating
* really needs like five more text editing passes and a good playtest
