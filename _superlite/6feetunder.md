Mystery with a hard-boiled, noir feel, written after *6 Against the Dark* as I was transitioning away from a "purchasing outcomes" framework and towards Apocalypse World's resolution system.

Uses a character generation method similar to that of *6 Against the Dark*, but replaces the standard three Act structure with one inspired by a "beat sheet" for a more fluid but still very board-game-like result.

I was about halfway done with it when I got bowled over by illness, and by the time I got back on my feet I'd moved on to a different approach entirely. I finished it up anyway but I think the resolution mechanics are handled and explained much better in the next set of games, polished up in *The Calypso Compendium*.
