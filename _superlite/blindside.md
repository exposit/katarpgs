Just a fun one this month, nothing too revolutionary. The idea is that you have a pool of pre-rolled dice you can sub in whenever you want, but if you run out, you suffer consequences.

* AW-style tiered resolution, using a dice pool and "pick two" mechanic.
* A decent character sheet that actually saves properly.
* A board-game style scene grid.
* Simple sliding character stats based on the ones in *A Dirty World*.
* Quite a few tables, though some are not new.
