PET is a framework for running your favorite system with virtual Players. Doesn't that sound nicer than "imaginary friends"?

* system agnostic; use your favorite mechanics
* uses a 2d6 pbta-style Oracle based on your desired outcome
* supports intraparty conflict (you can totally replicate those early D&D experiences where the rogue got bored and murdered the paladin for his stuff)
* an entire page of plot-pushing random tables
