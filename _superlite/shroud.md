This is a sexy game about disturbing witches. Maybe it's a disturbing game about needy people who pretend to be witches. Maybe it's a kickass paranormal romance. As always, it's your call.

I was intrigued by the "compelled" actions in a 200 Word RPG entry, [Last Night at the Safeword](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/rpg/2016/04/14/LastNightattheSafeword.html) and decided to run with the idea.

For my play test, I used this big list of [Witch traits](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2014/08/d100-witch-traits.html) to add some color, sex, and creepiness.

* Uses a d36 chart or deck of cards as the oracle, d6s as the randomizer.
* Pbta style core mechanic drawing on stat pools
* Stat pools you have to manage or risk chaos
