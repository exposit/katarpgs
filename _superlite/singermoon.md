The second game of the "one microRPG game a month" challenge (OMGAM)[https://exposit.github.io/omgam/] for 2019.

This was an exercise in putting too much effort into one aspect of the game; I spent most of the month making oracle cards and not enough of it making an actual game.

So no theme, and no art, other than the oracle cards, and a very barebones riff on an unpublished Everway-inspired game I wrote a while back.

* Generic.
* Oracle cards.
* Can be used as a framework with any system, but is a system in itself.
