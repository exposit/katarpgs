The seventh (!) game of my "one microRPG game a month" challenge. This one came in just under the wire; I uploaded it at about three minutes to midnight on the last day of 2017.

It's an homage to my first game <a href="https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/superlite/6hourstomidnight/">6 Hours to Midnight</a>.

It has a similar framing -- a party that leads to climax at the stroke of midnight -- and structure -- you're trying to earn coins to purchase outcomes at the end.

Unlike *6 Hours* it's much less demanding about how you get there, and there's no explicit love interest. Specific resources are replaced with a pool, too, and there's a new ability, "Magic", that allows you to do all sorts of crazy things.
