I was inspired by Chad Robb to write a [Lasers & Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/) hack inspired by [Watership Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down).

I'm not surprised people hack this system frequently; it's really very elegant. And the symmetry appeals.

Anyway, you control 1d6+1 bunnies, attempting to survive and reestablish their colony. Watch out for dogs!

I guess you could use this for a Walking Dead game too, with just a few tweaks, ha.

* Lasers & Feelings hack. Everyone else has one, why shouldn't I?
* Lots of tables, only some of which are unnecessary.
* The movie totally traumatized me as a kid.
