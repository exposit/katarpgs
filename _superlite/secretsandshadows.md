*Secrets & Shadows* and *Starfarer* are two skins to the same game. The former is paranormal romance, or urban fantasy, if you prefer, while the latter is straight science fiction. Draws heavily on *Lady Blackbird* for character generation and *Apocalypse World* for resolution and mechanics.

No built-in structure or end point, but plenty of color and situation starters to get things going and keep them moving. Should be playable solo or in a group, one shot or long term.

I expected to make a lot of these in different flavors, but ended up refining the system and condensing it, along with six or seven other scenarios, into *The Calypso Compendium*.
