The third game of the "one microRPG game a month" challenge <a href="https://exposit.github.io/omgam/">OMGAM</a> for 2019.

This one is a simple 3d6 generic game built on Approaches, pbta, and the Story Embryo/Hero's Journey. It is a game of hard hits and high risk, with an authorial framework to follow.

If you like my story games, you will like this one.

I think it would be better with a strong theme, but that's my weak spot. I may add some scenarios for it later, like *Calypso's*.

* Generic (possibly unfortunately).
* Uses a 3d6 expanded pbta resolution.
* Built-in story framework.
