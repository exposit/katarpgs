*... and no one is precisely who they seem to be, including you.*

Intrigue and romance in a time-based format designed to create a cohesive narrative story. And to encourage exploration of themes of love, sex, and rivalry in a rpg context. Inspired by S\lay with w/Me.

Probably suitable for solo play only, though you could possibly play with a GM and one or two players, maybe even competitively, assuming your group is cool with that and the major themes.

It's definitely designed as a one shot, with a decent number of things to keep track of, and very story focused, with a clear beginning, set up, and end.
