The first game of the "one microRPG game a month" challenge (OMGAM)[https://exposit.github.io/omgam/] for 2019.

A quick solo riff on Otherkin and [6 Hours to Midnight]({{site.baseurl}}/superlite/6hourstomidnight/) to get back in the swing of things! The theme is "nephilim", in an homage to my current UMF campaign.

* medium-weight theming but easily reskinnable
* Dice pool resolution with assignment.
* Lots of tables. Not really that much new there.
* Scene-based, with a simple metered chain of plot events.
