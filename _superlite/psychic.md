The second game of my "one microRPG game a month" challenge (OMGAM).

I was inspired by the TV show *Psych*, but it's really an homage to the whole genre of one hour sleuthing shows.

Shows built around likable, quirky people doing quirky things while solving mysteries, but always a bit odd and off-kilter, with a thick buffer of humor and absurdity to soften the blow of the murder.

* Dice pool resolution with tokens to add extra interest.
* Experiments with FATE-like Aspects (I should really read FATE one of these days).
* Heavy on the structure, with a Acts/Break model like the TV shows it mimics.
