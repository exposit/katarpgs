The fourth game of my "one microRPG game a month" challenge (OMGAM).

This one's fairly experimental, even for an OMGAM. Instead of defining your hero before the game starts, you begin with an (almost) blank slate.

You define positive and negative Traits with every dice roll, all within the context of the fiction as established and your own choices.

In play-testing I found this made for a very lively adventure with constant revelations. And one bad die roll can really leave you hurting!

* Dice pool resolution that's kinda AW-inspired, with on-the-fly Trait creation.
* Lots of tables, mostly new, and explicit directions for most of them.
* Scene-based; meters trigger plot events and the end game.
* Instructions for using it as a framework for other scenarios.
* A play example.
