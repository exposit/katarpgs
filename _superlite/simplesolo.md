This is a simple system agnostic soloing framework geared towards a dungeon delve/location-based adventure.

It's not innovative in any way, but if you need to introduce someone to the concept of soloing or if someone just wants to test out mechanics, it should suffice.

Note, most of the charts are from <a href="https://github.com/exposit/pythia-oracle/blob/master/HELP.md">Pythia Oracle</a>, but are obviously cut down to fit a one page format.

<div class="img_row">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/{{ page.link }}"><img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/{{ page.img}}" alt="" title="{{ page.title }}"/></a>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/{{ page.link }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
</div>
