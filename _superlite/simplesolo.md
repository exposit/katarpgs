This is a simple system agnostic soloing framework geared towards a dungeon delve/location-based adventure.

It's not innovative in any way, but if you need to introduce someone to the concept of soloing or if someone just wants to test out a non-solo system's mechanics, it should suffice.

Note, most of the charts are from <a href="https://github.com/exposit/pythia-oracle/blob/master/HELP.md">Pythia Oracle</a>, but are obviously cut down to fit a one page format.
